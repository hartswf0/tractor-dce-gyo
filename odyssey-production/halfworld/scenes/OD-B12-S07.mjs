/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B12-S07 — Zeus Destroys the Last Ship
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus wakes, smells the meat, condemns the act — the crew feasts six days.
     2. On the seventh day the wind falls and the ship leaves Thrinacia.
     3. Zeus gathers a black cloud and strikes the mast with lightning.
     4. The ship shatters and every crewman drowns; Odysseus lashes keel and mast.
     5. Driven back to Charybdis, he hangs from the fig tree until the timbers
        reemerge, then drifts alone to Calypso.

   Stage layout (back -> front, read left -> right as the causal sweep on one clock):
     LEFT  — ZEUS'S THUNDERBOLT: the black storm-cloud gathering over the sea, the
             forked bolt lancing down onto the masthead, the white impact flash and
             the shockwave rolling out. The divine blow that opens the wreck.
     CENTRE— the FINAL BLACK SHIP carried through its end: the last galley sailing
             from Thrinacia, struck, dismasted, then its keel and mast splitting
             free — the vessel coming apart under the sky.
     FRONT — the DROWNING CREW flung from the foundering hull across the swell,
             flailing and taken under one by one, rings of foam closing over them.
     RIGHT — the FIG TREE ABOVE CHARYBDIS, its long branch arching over the maw,
             with ODYSSEUS clinging like a bat at the hang-point, waiting out the
             vortex for the timbers to reemerge before he drifts alone to Calypso.
   The bolt, the shattering ship, the drowning men, the fig-tree refuge and the
   lone survivor — all held on one clock in a single still.
