/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B08-S05 — The Trojan Horse Song and the Name
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus gives Demodocus a choice cut of meat and asks for the song of
        the wooden horse.
     2. The bard sings the Greeks' emergence, the sack, and Odysseus's attack on
        Deiphobus's house.
     3. Odysseus weeps like a captive woman over a fallen husband.
     4. Alcinous stops the music and asks the stranger for his name, homeland,
        and reason for grief.
     5. Odysseus prepares to narrate his wanderings.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     the FEAST HALL AT ATTENTIVE SILENCE as the empty navigable set, full bleed:
     back wall + niche, columns, the bard's seat left, the raised narrative
     guest-seat centre, banquet tables, and every gaze-line converged on the
     hushed focus.
       -> the TROJAN-SACK MEMORY as a faint ghost field surfacing over the hall
          — the burning skyline, the wooden horse spilling its ambush, the wall
          combat and the bowed captives — the exact song welling up made visible.
       -> DEMODOCUS at the left, on the bard's seat: the blind inspired singer
          pouring the exact tale, lyre raised, unaware of the stranger's grief.
       -> ALCINOUS enthroned right: the host who catches the weeping, stops the
          music, and turns to ask the stranger his name.
       -> ODYSSEUS, foreground centre at the narrative seat: the guest who asked
          for the song and now weeps like a captive woman, then lifts his eyes,
          preparing to name himself and narrate his wanderings.
   The gift of meat, the exact song, the hidden weeping, the halted music and
   the asked name — all held on one clock in a single still.
