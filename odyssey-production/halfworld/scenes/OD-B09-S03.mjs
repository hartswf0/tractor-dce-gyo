/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B09-S03 — The Lotus-Eaters
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. A north wind drives the ships off course for nine days.
     2. They land among the Lotus-eaters and send three scouts inland.
     3. The inhabitants offer lotus; those who taste it lose all desire for home.
     4. Odysseus drags the weeping men back, binds them under the benches, and
        departs.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     the LOTUS SHORE AND MEADOW as the empty navigable set, full bleed: the
     becalmed sea and return-lane, the flowering food-field, the landing beach
     and the inland path the scouts wandered up.
       -> the LOTUS-EATERS, placid hosts clustered in the meadow, gently turned
          to the landing and holding out the honey-sweet blossoms — offering,
          never pursuing.
       -> a hero LOTUS FRUIT, the offered bloom made large at the point of
          contact: offered -> tasted -> euphoric -> removed as the beats turn.
       -> the THREE SCOUTS sent inland, read left-to-right as the whole
          seduction in one frame: one still exploring, one sunk dreamy over the
          lotus, one hauled back weeping and clinging to the ground.
       -> ODYSSEUS, foreground: the captain who catches the loss, drags the
          weeping men back, and orders immediate departure.
   The nine-day wind, the landing, the drugged forgetting and the forced return
   — all held on one clock in a single still.
