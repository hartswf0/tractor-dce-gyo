/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B06-S01 — Athena Enters Nausicaa's Dream
   A thin Halfworld COMPOSITION module. It places existing atlas assets on one
   master clock; it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   pass over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Athena reaches the palace of Alcinous and enters Nausicaa's chamber in
        the likeness of a friend.
     2. She reproaches the princess for leaving fine clothes unwashed before
        marriage.
     3. Nausicaa wakes, asks her father for a wagon, and conceals the marriage
        motive.
     4. Alcinous orders the mule cart prepared; her mother packs food, wine,
        and oil.

   Staging (a left->right causal tableau on one clock, back -> front):
     the Phaeacian royal chamber frames the WHOLE set (the protected princess
     bedroom, its dream-entry window admitting the goddess's descent)
       -> the dream-companion FX pools on the LEFT over the bed (beats 1-2 —
          Athena bent close as a familiar girl, whispering the reproach at the
          sleeper's ear)
       -> Nausicaa herself stands CENTER, newly woken and taking practical
          initiative (beat 3 — the girl who wakes from the dream and asks for
          the wagon, the marriage motive kept inside)
       -> the laundry wagon stands READIED at the RIGHT (beat 4 / exit — the
          mule cart prepared, the load aboard)
       -> the sorted laundry bundles ride FOREGROUND by the cart (beat 4 — the
          fine clothes packed with the mother's food, wine, and oil).
   Dream on the left, waking princess at the center, the readied cart on the
   right — the whole morning read on one clock.
