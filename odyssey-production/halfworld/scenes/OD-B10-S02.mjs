/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B10-S02 — The Laestrygonian Harbor
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. The fleet enters a narrow harbor ringed by cliffs; Odysseus alone moors
        outside.
     2. Three scouts meet a giant girl who directs them to her parents' house.
     3. The queen summons Antiphates, who seizes and eats one scout.
     4. Laestrygonians mass on the cliffs, spear crews like fish, and crush the
        trapped ships with boulders.
     5. Odysseus cuts his cable and escapes with only his own ship.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     TELEPYLUS HARBOR, full bleed — the empty trap-set: cliff ring, high attack
     ledges, the switchback city path, the single narrow entrance neck and the
     outer anchorage where Odysseus keeps his own ship off (the "empty-basin"
     layers, so the intact moorings don't fight the wrecks laid over them).
       -> ANTIPHATES AND QUEEN, an inset up on the city cliff (top right) — the
          king's hall where the queen summons Antiphates and he seizes a scout.
       -> the DESTROYED FLEET, crushed and splintering down in the enclosed basin
          — the eleven black galleys smashed by boulders, decks empty.
       -> the LAESTRYGONIAN GIANTS massed along the cliff rim above the basin
          (their own harbour/boats layers dropped — the real harbor and fleet play
          those parts), hurling boulders and spearing the swimmers like fish.
       -> ODYSSEUS in the foreground at the outer anchorage — moored outside the
          throat, first watching the slaughter, then cutting his cable to escape
          with only his own ship.
   The narrow-harbor trap, the summons, the seized scout, the massing giants and
   the crushed fleet, and the lone escape — all held on one clock in a single still.
