/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B09-S02 — The Raid on the Cicones
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus's fleet sacks Ismarus and divides the captured wealth.
     2. He orders immediate departure, but the crews remain to feast.
     3. Cicones from inland arrive in organized force and fight through the day.
     4. Six men from every ship are killed before the fleet escapes at dusk.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     the ISMARUS COAST AND TOWN as the empty navigable set, full bleed: the
     sacked walled town smoking on the inland ridge, the trampled battlefield,
     the raiders' camp, the beached ship-line and the open sea, with the marked
     retreat route winding gate -> field -> camp -> ships.
       -> the CICONES ARMY massing across the inland band: the disciplined
          reinforcements pouring from the tree-line into ranked lines with
          spears and chariots, then leaning the whole advance down onto the beach.
       -> the TWELVE-SHIP FLEET drawn up at the waterline right: the squadron
          hauled on the strand, gangplank down loading the spoils, then shoving
          off, taking a casualty, and the flight to sea at dusk.
       -> ODYSSEUS'S FLEET CREWS on the beach left: victorious raiders driving up
          the sand, sprawling careless around the fire to feast, then crouched in
          a desperate shield-line when the Cicones counter.
       -> ODYSSEUS, foreground centre: the captain who takes Ismarus and divides
          the wealth, flings an arm up ordering immediate departure his men ignore,
          and finally strides for the ships leading the dusk escape.
   The sack, the ignored order, the day-long fight and the costly escape — all
   held on one clock in a single still.
