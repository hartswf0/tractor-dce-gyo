   SCENE  OD-B07-S03 — Supplication at Arete's Knees
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Athena's mist falls away only when Odysseus reaches Arete.
     2. He clasps her knees and asks passage home, then sits humbly in the ashes
        by the hearth.
     3. The hall remains silent until the elder Echeneus tells Alcinous to raise
        the suppliant.
     4. Odysseus is seated beside the king, fed, and promised a convoy home.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     the ROYAL HEARTH as the empty navigable set, full bleed: the lit stone
     fire-ring, the ash bed, the supplication slab in front, the rise-assist
     post, and the guest-seat to the right — the whole architecture of the rite.
       -> ALCINOUS enthroned right, by the guest-seat: first stunned by the
          stranger at his hearth, then rising to raise and welcome him.
       -> ARETE, the crowned queen, centre-right: the appeal is made to HER
          first — she receives it, still and shrewd, weighing the suppliant.
       -> ECHENEUS, the eldest counsellor, left: grave in the silence, then
          risen with the admonishing finger to bid the king lift the guest.
       -> ODYSSEUS, foreground centre, low at the queen's knees in the ashes —
          the suppliant clasping her knees and asking passage home.
   The mist's falling, the clasped knees, the broken silence, and the guest
   raised and promised his ship — all held on one clock in a single still.
