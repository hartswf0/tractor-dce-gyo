/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B12-S01 — Elpenor's Funeral
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. The ship returns to Aeaea and the exhausted crew sleeps on shore.
     2. At dawn they retrieve Elpenor's body, burn it with his armor, and raise
        a mound.
     3. They plant his oar at the top as promised.
     4. Circe arrives with food, wine, and knowledge that they have returned
        from death.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     THE AEAEA FUNERAL SHORE fills the whole field — the sunrise sky over Circe's
     dark forest, the strip of sea with the black ship drawn up at the landing,
     the broad burial beach carrying the burned-out pyre crib, the fresh mound
     with the planted oar, and the low feast set in the foreground; the path
     rising through the trees to Circe's hall lies at the right.
       -> the CREW work the rite across the beach — carrying, burning, and
          raising the barrow, then setting the oar as they promised.
       -> ELPENOR'S BODY AND OAR is the focus at the mound: borne on its bier,
          laid on the pyre, and at last the oar stands planted in the barrow.
       -> ODYSSEUS in the near foreground, grieving, keeping the vow and turning
          to greet Circe as she comes down from the forest.
       -> CIRCE arrives at the right from the tree-path with food and wine and
          the knowledge that they have come back alive out of death.
   Landfall and exhausted sleep, the dawn rite and the raised mound, the oar set
   upright, and Circe's arrival — all on one clock in one still.
