/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B11-S06 — Agamemnon's Warning
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Agamemnon drinks and tells how Aegisthus and Clytemnestra murdered him
        at a feast.
     2. He describes Cassandra's death and his wife's refusal even to close his eyes.
     3. He warns Odysseus to return secretly and distrust women.
     4. He asks about Orestes, but Odysseus has no news.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     THE MURDER-FEAST MEMORY fills the field behind everything: the remembered
     banquet turning to ambush inside one faint hall — cups tipping, the guests
     toppling, Cassandra reaching, the great doors swinging shut. It TRANSFORMS
     from feast toward sealed ambush across the scene as Agamemnon relives it.
       -> THE CONSPIRATORS, Clytemnestra and Aegisthus, faint memory-figures
          hung mid-field: first leaning together to plot, then the queen's
          dagger flung overhead to strike, then cold and still. The agents of
          the deed, recalled inside the same account.
       -> AGAMEMNON'S SHADE at the left foreground, the murdered king reliving
          it: raging over the murder, then bowed in humiliation at Cassandra's
          death and his wife closing not even his eyes, then leaning in to thrust
          his bitter warning at Odysseus, then lifting an open, pleading hand to
          ask after his son Orestes.
       -> ODYSSEUS at the right foreground, turned to the shade and listening —
          grave, then downcast: he has no news of Orestes to give.
   The telling, the remembered ambush, the two conspirators, the warning and the
   unanswered question about the son — all held on one clock in a single still.
