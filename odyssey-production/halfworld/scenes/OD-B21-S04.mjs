/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B21-S04 — Odysseus Recruits the Herdsmen      (Od. 21.188–244)
   Book XXI, scene 4. ADDITIVE: adds nothing to Books I–XV, modifies no
   existing module, and casts only assets that already exist. Shape copied from
   the reference scene, scenes/OD-B16-S03.mjs, and from its immediate
   predecessor OD-B21-S03, whose computed exit occupancy this scene imports.

   Beats (causal order, one master clock):
     1. Antinous has put the bow by until tomorrow, and the beggar follows the
        two herdsmen OUT of the hall by the side door into the private flank of
        the yard — the one piece of the compound the men in the hall cannot see
        into. He tests them there: if a god put Odysseus in this yard this
        minute, which side would you be on?
     2. They answer without hedging. Philoetius prays for the day; Eumaeus prays
        for it too, and the answer is what buys them the truth.
     3. He draws the rag back off his right thigh and shows them the tusk wound,
        and says the words: I am he, home in the twentieth year.
     4. Both men read the mark, both know it, and they take hold of him and weep
        on the blind ground behind the wall.
     5. He stops the weeping before it can be heard indoors and gives three
        orders that are all geography: Eumaeus is to put the bow and quiver into
        his hands when he asks for them, Philoetius is to shut the courtyard gate
        and lash it fast, and between them they are to bolt the women in.

   ---- HOW THIS SCENE IS BUILT (Book XVI+ discipline) ----------------------

   A. NOTHING HAND-PLACED. Every body in this scene is resolved by STATION NAME
      through a plan, and `blockingAt()` does the arithmetic. There is not one
      invented coordinate in the blocking table.

   B. THE PLAN IS THE SET'S OWN (brief §A, "author a small local plan"). This
      scene plays OUTDOORS, so it is not the megaron and not the hut — but the
      outdoor set it plays on, `location.palace-outer-yard`, was authored for
      exactly this scene and it ALREADY EXPORTS a `makePlan()` of its own, with
      its anchors projected from that plan rather than eyeballed. Authoring a
      second, private table of yard stations here would be the collage mistake
      the brief exists to stop: two tables for one yard, and the paint agreeing
      with neither. So the local plan below is built with `makePlan()` as the
      brief asks, but its station table OPENS with the set's own stations, and
      adds exactly THREE — the three places outside the side door the men are
      standing on when the scene opens. Every other name this scene uses
      (`oath_l`/`oath_c`/`oath_r`, `lee_wall`, `gate_sill`, `door_sill`,
      `oath_watch`) is the SET'S, so a body on it stands on ground the set has
      painted for it: the oath trio lands exactly on the three pairs of
      footprints the `oath` state scuffs into the dirt.

   C. CONTACT TRIO, not a contact pair (brief §B). Three men embrace here, so
      two paired stations are not enough. The set ships `oath_l` / `oath_c` /
      `oath_r` — three stations 0.09 apart in plan x on the blind patch — and
      this scene widens that gauge to 0.12 as `stand_l` / `stand_c` / `stand_r`,
      DERIVED from the set's three by a declared offset rather than invented,
      because draft 1 rendered the set's own spacing as one tangle with three
      heads on it. The three bodies now resolve about 110px apart on a 1120px
      frame, which at this figure height is an embrace and not a collision, and
      each of them still stands on the near rim of his own painted pair of
      footprints. Nobody is ever assigned a station another body holds.

   D. ONE BODY, ONE GUISE CHANNEL (brief §C). Odysseus is
      `character.odysseus-b16` with `guise:"beggar"`, and he STAYS in rags —
      Athena does not touch him in this scene and there is no restoration flare,
      because the proof offered here is not a new body, it is an old scar. But
      the recognition is not nothing, so the guise channel carries it: from the
      declaration onward the guise becomes `{from:"beggar", to:"king", u}` with
      u ramping only to 0.34. That is BELOW the module's `snapAt` of 0.5, so the
      garment does NOT snap — the rags stay rags — while scale, skin and hair
      colour lerp continuously and the beggar's stoop comes out of him in front
      of the two men who have just been told who he is. One body, no cut, and
      the one discontinuity the guise channel has is never crossed.

   E. THE ROOM IS STATE (brief §D). One field, `location.palace-outer-yard`,
      cast ONCE, with its state channel driven by the clock: `private` while the
      test is being put and the scar shown, then `oath` from the moment the
      pledge closes — which lays the three pairs of footprints into the patch
      the three men are standing on. The gate is NOT barred here: that is S06's
      work and S06's state.

   F. THE PROOF IS A PLATE, NOT A BODY PART. `set_piece.scar-proof` is a
      deposition diagram — an aperture cut in the rag, the welt, two witness
      sightline cones, a tally of assents and an oath seal. It is not a limb to
      be pasted onto a 200px figure; it is the EXHIBIT, and it is laid into the
      frame the way OD-B21-S03 lays its tallow panel: a windowed plate over its
      own paper field and one hard rule, top right, on sky the set leaves empty.
      Its four modes are stepped by the same clock that moves the bodies —
      covered while his hand is still going down to the rag, presented when the
      flaps are clamped back, witnessed when both men have looked, sworn when
      the pledge closes. The plate and the men are one event.

   G. SHEET SIZE IS THE WHOLE TRICK (device verbatim from OD-B21-S03). The proof
      plate's rules are typed in FIXED PIXELS, so drawn on its 660x880 design
      sheet and blitted down to the 282px the sky can spare — a 0.44 reduction —
      every rule in it lands at under 2px and the welt prints as a scatter of
      stray dots. Drawn instead on a 330x440 sheet the geometry halves while
      those fixed rules do not, so the same window blits at 0.89 and the plate
      keeps a hard contour the dot lattice can actually resolve.

   H. ONE DEPTH QUEUE. Everything standing on this floor is pushed with its live
      blocked z and drawn far -> near, so the near herdsmen close in FRONT of
      the man they are taking hold of and nobody is stacked wrong.

   I. STRUCTURED HANDOFF (brief §E/§G). `exitOccupancy` is computed by
      `occupancyAt()` and exported as a NAMED binding. S05 goes back inside, so
      it will have to translate these yard stations into hall stations — the map
      belongs to the scene that crosses the threshold, not to this one.

/* ---- THE LOCAL PLAN (note B) --------------------------------------------
   The set's own stations, plus the three the door needs. The three added ones
   are the only new geometry in this file, and they exist for one reason: three
   men who have just come through one doorway must not open the scene on top of
   each other. The set's `door_sill` / `door_foot` are 24px apart on a 1120px
   frame, which is fine for a prop and useless for two bodies, so the men open
   from three stations spread across the door's own step and staggered in depth,
   ordered left -> right to MATCH the left -> right order of the oath trio they
   walk to. That ordering is what keeps three lanes from crossing: nobody
   overtakes anybody, so no two bodies ever converge on one point. */
const YS = YARD_PLAN.stations;
/* THE CONTACT TRIO, RE-GAUGED (note C). The set's own `oath_l`/`oath_c`/`oath_r`
   sit 0.090 apart in plan x, which resolves to 80px on a 1120px frame. At the
   figure height this set actually needs (K_YARD below, ~228px of body) 80px is
   inside the arm span of `eum_grieve` and `phi_clasp`, and draft 1 rendered the
   embrace as one tangle with three heads on it. So the trio is widened by
   0.030 in plan x, DERIVED from the set's own stations by a declared offset
   rather than invented, and pushed forward in z as well. Each man's feet land
   within 0.01–0.04 of plan space of HIS OWN painted pair of prints — a few tens
   of pixels, just in FRONT of them, which is what a fresh print looks like when
   the man who made it has shifted his weight. The trio sits on the near rim of
   the trodden ellipse rather than dead in its middle, and that is the right
   place for it: the prints read as the record of the embrace instead of as a
   decal under three pairs of shoes.

   THE TRIO IS ALSO STAGGERED IN DEPTH, not laid out on one line. Draft 2 put
   all three at nearly one z, so all three heads landed within 20px of y=0.58 —
   which is exactly where the yard wall's first two bays carry their top
   courses. Three faces printed on one masonry band. Pushing the two herdsmen
   NEARER by different amounts (+0.030 and +0.050 in z) drops their feet, lifts
   their crowns clear of that course, and turns a row of three into a triangle
   closing on the man in the middle — which is what an embrace looks like from
   outside it. The z offsets are also what keeps the depth queue honest: the two
   men who take hold of him are unambiguously in FRONT of him. */

/* ---- THE BOX A BODY IS DRAWN IN (verbatim device from S01 / S02 / S03) ---
   placeInstance() hands a module a box of the STAGE's aspect (1120x760, 1.474
   wide), and every character module in this repo lays its garment out in
   fractions of its box WIDTH, so a landscape box turns a body into a bell.
   Every figure here is drawn into the PORTRAIT box the atlas uses for
   characters, 660/880, and blitted. FIG_FLOOR is the rig's own floor line:
   figure-hero plants the ankles at 0.90 of its box height.

   K_YARD is this set's one height for an adult, and unlike the hall's it is
   SOLVED, not inherited. The set's side door is 0.235 plan-height at z=0.16,
   which draws 0.160 of H; the yard wall bays are 0.096–0.138, which draw about
   0.08–0.11 of H. Against that masonry a 1.75m man standing on the oath patch
   (z≈0.70, where the set's own footprints are) wants a drawn body of about
   0.27 of H — 205px on a 760px frame. The rig fills 0.78 of its box between
   crown and ankle, and project() returns 1.026 at that depth, so
   K_YARD = 0.27 / 0.78 / 1.026 = 0.34. That is smaller than the hall's 0.46,
   which is correct: the hall is a box the camera is inside and this is a yard
   with a building at the far end of it.

   DRAFT 1 RENDERED AT 0.34 AND IT WAS TOO SMALL — three 205px men on a 760px
   frame, and worse, their heads landed at y≈0.58, dead on the top course of the
   yard wall's first bay, so three faces printed against masonry instead of
   against paper. 0.39 lifts the drawn body to 0.292 of H (222px) and the heads
   to y≈0.53, clear ABOVE the wall course and onto the open field. It costs
   strictness: depth-corrected against the 2.8m side door these men now read
   about 1.35x life size. That is the same trade every scene in this atlas
   makes — the hall's 0.46 is looser still — and it is the right one, because a
   scene whose entire subject is two men reading a mark on a third man's leg
