/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B08-S03 — The Athletic Challenge
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Phaeacian youths compete in running, wrestling, jumping, discus, boxing.
     2. Laodamas invites Odysseus; Euryalus insults him as a merchant with no
        athletic skill.
     3. Angered, Odysseus hurls a discus beyond every mark and challenges the
        athletes.
     4. Alcinous calms the confrontation and shifts the display toward dance
        and song.

   Stage layout (the marked games ground, back -> front):
     PHAEACIAN ATHLETIC FIELD as the empty navigable set (full bleed) — the
     diagrammatic top-down games ground: numbered track, wrestling ring, long-
     jump pit, boxing square, and the discus throwing arc fanning to its
     distance markers. This is the geography every beat sits on.
       -> EURYALUS left, the cocky young athlete whose careless insult triggers
          the demonstration (beat 2).
       -> LAODAMAS right, the courteous prince who invites the guest and later
          helps mend the hall (beats 2, 4).
       -> the DISCUS in flight over the sector — the heavy disk Odysseus hurls
          beyond every distance marker (beat 3).
       -> ODYSSEUS foreground centre at the throwing circle, arm thrown up on
          the release, then challenging the athletes (beat 3), composed again as
          Alcinous calms the field (beat 4).
   Invitation, insult, the great throw, and the king's calming all held on one
   clock over a single marked field.
