/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B05-S02 — Calypso Receives the Order
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Calypso recognizes Hermes, offers ambrosia and nectar, and asks his
        purpose.
     2. Hermes reports Zeus's command and warns her against divine anger.
     3. Calypso denounces the gods' jealousy toward goddesses who love mortal
        men.
     4. She agrees to release Odysseus but says she cannot escort him herself.

   Stage layout (back -> front):
     Ogygia's cavern-and-grove set (full-bleed; the island cave where she keeps
     Odysseus, her own hearth-loom held back so the hero loom reads)
       -> Calypso's fine upright FRAME LOOM, her weaving set to the right, still
          active as the scene opens and abandoned by its close
       -> the AMBROSIA-AND-NECTAR SERVICE she sets before her divine guest,
          low and centred between the two immortals
       -> CALYPSO foreground-right, the proud host turned to the messenger —
          gracious welcome, then outrage, then the dignified release
       -> HERMES foreground-left, the swift messenger arrived with Zeus's word,
          caduceus at rest, delivering the command.
   One clock: the welcome, the order, the goddess's protest, and her reluctant
   yielding all fold onto the master time.
