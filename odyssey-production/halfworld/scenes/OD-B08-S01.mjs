   SCENE  OD-B08-S01 — The Phaeacian Assembly and the Ship
   Book 1. A THIN Halfworld composition module: it places existing atlas asset
   instances on one clock. It does NOT redraw any asset. The engine runs ONE
   dotify + scene card over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single
   halftone. Deterministic (no Date/random).

   Beats (causal order):
     1. At dawn Athena moves through the city in a herald's form, calling the
        people to assembly.
     2. She makes Odysseus appear larger and more impressive as he enters.
     3. Alcinous orders fifty-two sailors to prepare a ship and invites the
        nobles to feast.
     4. The people ready the vessel while the palace fills for celebration.

   Composition (back -> front):
     location.phaeacian-assembly-ground  (full-bleed seaside civic bowl: harbor,
        palace connection, ship-route slipway, paved floor, rising tiers, king's
        raised place. The set's OWN baked back ship is dropped so the convoy-ship
        vehicle is THE readied vessel.)
     vehicle.phaeacian-convoy-ship       (the swift self-steering galley moored in
        the harbour, being made ready — moored, then the boarding plank run out)
     ensemble.phaeacian-sailors          (the fifty-two-man work-gang launching,
        masting, provisioning and inspecting the hull on the strand, foreground)
     character.athena-as-herald          (the disguised goddess, the mobile civic
        voice moving through the ground, proclaiming the call to assembly)
     character.odysseus                  (the stranger entering, drawn LARGER and
        more impressive by Athena's grace — foreground centre, the biggest figure)
