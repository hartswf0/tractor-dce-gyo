/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B09-S09 — The Blinding
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Polyphemus drinks three bowls, promises Nobody the last death, and
        collapses.
     2. Odysseus heats the stake until it glows and the men drive it into the
        Cyclops's eye.
     3. They twist it as blood and steam erupt; Polyphemus wakes with a roar and
        tears it free.
     4. Other Cyclopes call from outside but leave when he says Nobody is killing
        him.
     5. Polyphemus gropes at the entrance while the men hide among the animals.

   Stage layout — a paneled cave splash, unified by the single halftone:
     Polyphemus's cave (full-bleed page ground, sealed door, fire down to embers)
       -> CYCLOPES-OUTSIDE, an upper-left vignette: the roused neighbours at the
          sealed mouth, distant silhouettes calling in (beats 3-4)
       -> the EYE-BLINDING-EFFECT, the focal medallion upper-centre: the burning
          stake driven into the one giant eye — burst, ember, steam, blood
       -> the FOUR STAKE BEARERS across the lower centre: the braced team spinning
          the glowing olive stake like a drill (the mechanism of the deed)
       -> POLYPHEMUS colossal at right, reeling — drunken collapse into the
          blinding, both fists driven to the ruined eye, then groping at the door
       -> ODYSSEUS foreground-left, the crafty captain directing the drive, then
          slipping among the animals as the deed is done.
   One clock: the collapse, the heated drive, the twist and roar, the neighbours'
   calling, and the blind groping all fold onto the master time.
