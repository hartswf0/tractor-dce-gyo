   SCENE  OD-B16-S04 — The Plan against the Suitors
   Book XVI, scene 4 of 6. ADDITIVE: creates nothing, modifies nothing;
   it only COMPOSES assets that already exist.

   Shape copied from the reference scene, scenes/OD-B16-S03.mjs:
     · no hand-placed anchors — every position resolves through
       scenes/_plans/megaron.mjs via blockingAt()
     · ONE body for Odysseus — character.odysseus-b16 with guise:"restored",
       carried forward from the reveal in S03 (never a cut to .odysseus-restored)
     · structured handoff — exitOccupancy is computed, and S05 imports it

   ROOM. location.megaron-hall, state "day": the ordinary hall, arms still on
   the walls, fire low, benches in order — the room BEFORE the misrule of the
   feast, and the room this whole conversation is about. It is the one hall
   asset with a state channel; no second hall is built or cast.

   THE HANDOFF ACROSS A ROOM CHANGE. S03 ends with father and son at the
   contact pair centre_l / centre_r of the HUT plan. Those station names do not
   exist in the megaron — blockingAt() would throw, which is the cross-room
   continuity check doing its job. So the incoming occupancy is not discarded,
   it is TRANSLATED: each hut station maps to the megaron station that plays
   the same role, and the map is applied to the imported occupancy rather than
   to a guess. Change where S03 leaves them and this scene moves with it.

   Beats (Od. 16.226–320):
     1. Odysseus tells how the Phaeacians set him ashore, and asks the count.
     2. Telemachus counts the factions off — a hundred and eight, and heralds.
     3. Odysseus names Zeus and Athena, and lays out the removal of the arms.
     4. Telemachus is to go back, endure the insults, and tell no one.
     5. Eumaeus is given the errand of bringing the beggar down later.

   the scene object (OD-B16-S03.mjs line 83) and exports no binding by that
