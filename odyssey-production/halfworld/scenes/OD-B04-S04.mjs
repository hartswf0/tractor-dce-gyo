/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B04-S04 — The Wooden Horse
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Menelaus answers with the story of the wooden horse.
     2. Helen circled the horse and imitated the voices of the warriors' wives.
     3. The hidden Greeks nearly answered; Odysseus restrained them and
        silenced Anticlus.
     4. Telemachus hears proof of his father's endurance and command.

   Stage layout (back -> front):
     the wooden-horse interior cavity (ribs, planks, ladder, roof hatch,
     light-leaking seams — the whole hollow set, full frame)
       -> the hidden Greek warriors packed in the belly (the tempted knot,
          one man being forcibly stilled)
       -> Helen at the horse's flank, calling in a borrowed voice (right)
       -> Odysseus foreground, reaching to clamp and silence Anticlus
       -> the imitated wives' voices, an emitter diagram circling the shell
          (upper-left inset annotation).
   The interior holds the men; Helen's mimicry leaks through the seam; the
   voice-diagram walks the temptation around the hull; Odysseus holds the line.
