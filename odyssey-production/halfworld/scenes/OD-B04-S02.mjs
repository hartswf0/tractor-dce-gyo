/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B04-S02 — Recognition through Tears
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Menelaus speaks of Odysseus and Telemachus hides his tears behind his cloak.
     2. Helen enters, recognizes Telemachus by resemblance, and names him aloud.
     3. Pisistratus confirms the identity and recalls his own dead brother Antilochus.
     4. All four weep until Menelaus calls for the mourning to end with the meal.

   Stage layout (back -> front):
     Menelaus's luminous hall (full-frame set, wedding-feast dressing)
       -> the SHARED-MOURNING grief-field (field + collapse-lattice + the
          spoken-name source at center) binding the four through a common
          center — its own mourner-bodies are dropped so the four REAL
          characters occupy the bound positions
       -> Helen (far-left, entering radiant, the recognition arriving whole)
       -> Pisistratus (far-right, confirming, then bowed on his dead brother)
       -> Telemachus (near-left foreground, tears hidden behind the cloak)
       -> Menelaus (near-right foreground, the host who speaks the name and,
          at the last, calls the mourning to end with the meal).

   Exit / continuity: all four weep until Menelaus calls for the mourning to
   end with the meal.
