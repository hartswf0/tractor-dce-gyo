/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B03-S03 — The Broken Return from Troy
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Nestor recounts the feud between Agamemnon and Menelaus after Troy fell.
     2. Half the fleet sailed; Odysseus turned back to support Agamemnon.
     3. Nestor, Diomedes, and Menelaus escaped by a difficult route and reached home.
     4. Nestor admits he learned Odysseus's later fate only through scattered reports.

   Stage layout (back -> front):
     the sea-route map — the whole chart of the homeward lanes, the backdrop the
     old king traces with his finger (full frame)
       -> the divided Achaean fleet — a window of open sea up on the horizon band
          where the armada comes apart into its lanes
       -> the Atreid kings' memory variant — Agamemnon and Menelaus locked in the
          quarrel that split the host (left)
       -> Odysseus' memory variant — the commander wheeling the ships about to turn
          back for Agamemnon (centre)
       -> Nestor — foreground narrator, mapping the routes with regret, his gaze
          drifting off at the end into the scattered reports of Odysseus' fate.
   The map is the thing Nestor MAPS; the fleet and the two memory figures are the
   remembered content his tracing hand summons across it.
