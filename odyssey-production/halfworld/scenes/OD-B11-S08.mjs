/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B11-S08 — Judges, Punishments, and Flight
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus sees Minos judging the dead and Orion hunting shades of animals.
     2. He sees Tityus attacked by vultures, Tantalus unable to drink or eat, and
        Sisyphus pushing his stone.
     3. Heracles's phantom speaks while the hero himself feasts among gods.
     4. The dead crowd closer and Odysseus fears Persephone may send a monster.
     5. He retreats to the ship and sails back across Ocean.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     PUNISHMENT LANDSCAPE fills the whole field — the gloomy underworld plain,
     its judgment dais, hunting field, vulture ledge, receding pool and rolling-
     stone slope drawn as the world every following body is set into.
       -> the CLOSING GHOST SURGE, a swelling pale crowd massed from the left and
          pressing inward on the escape gap toward the ship at the right; it lies
          low and sparse early (beat 1-2) and rears into a closing wall at beat 4.
       -> the TITYUS-TANTALUS-AND-SISYPHUS triptych centre-ground: the three
          endless punishments turning together on their own constraint loops.
       -> MINOS enthroned at the left on the judgment dais, gold sceptre lifted,
          delivering his decrees over the disputes of the dead.
       -> HERACLES'S PHANTOM right-of-centre, the dark armed double frozen at the
          hunt, bow drawn then flung forward as it speaks from the dead.
       -> ODYSSEUS at the right foreground, the witness — turned back over his
          shoulder at the judged and the damned, then seized by fear of a monster
          and breaking toward the ship on the fleeing point the surge drives at.
   The judge, the three sufferers, the speaking phantom, the closing dead and the
   hero's flight — all held on one clock in a single still.
