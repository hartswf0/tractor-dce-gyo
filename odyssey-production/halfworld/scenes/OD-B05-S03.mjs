/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B05-S03 — Odysseus Distrusts Freedom
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order, one clock):
     1. Calypso finds Odysseus weeping on the shore and tells him to build a
        raft for home.
     2. He suspects a trap and demands a binding oath that she will not plan
        his ruin.
     3. Calypso swears by earth, sky, and Styx and offers practical help.
     4. At supper she argues that immortality with her surpasses Penelope;
        Odysseus tactfully refuses.

   Stage layout (back -> front):
     the Ogygia shore set (rocky lookout, weeping rock, sea horizon, cave path)
       -> the Oath of Styx sealing in the upper air over the sea (a divine
          apparition that GATHERS while he weeps and demands, then is SWORN
          fast when she takes the vow — driven off the fx clock)
       -> Calypso on the ledge, left of the weeping rock (welcome -> swearing
          release -> tender persuasion), always turned toward him
       -> Odysseus foreground-right at the weeping rock (grieving -> the wary
          demand for the oath -> the crafty, tactful refusal at supper).
   Ogygia held on one clock: the mortal's distrust, the goddess's binding vow,
   and the quiet refusal of immortality, all on the same shore.
