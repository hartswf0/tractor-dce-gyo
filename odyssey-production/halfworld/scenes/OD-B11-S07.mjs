/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B11-S07 — Achilles Chooses Life in Retrospect
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Achilles approaches with Patroclus, Antilochus, and Ajax nearby.
     2. Odysseus praises his honor among the dead, but Achilles rejects death's glory.
     3. He asks about Peleus and Neoptolemus.
     4. Odysseus recounts Neoptolemus's courage at Troy; Achilles strides away rejoicing.
     5. Ajax alone refuses reconciliation and withdraws in silence.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     the CIMMERIAN SHORE + UNDERWORLD PIT holds the whole sunless field — the
     dead sea, the grove, the trench where the blood was poured and the shades
     throng.
       -> the NEOPTOLEMUS-AT-TROY MEMORY rises glowing at upper-right: the four
          proud memory-cells (council, horse, combat, departure) that Odysseus's
          telling calls up, and that flare Achilles back to pride.
       -> PATROCLUS & ANTILOCHUS, the pale honor guard, flank the center where
          Achilles arrives — silent attendance on either side.
       -> AJAX's shade, a huge hulking armored figure at the far left, refusing:
          the eloquent silence, back half-turned, that will withdraw unanswered.
       -> ACHILLES's shade centre-left: approaching in regret, rejecting the
          glory of the dead, then REVIVED by his son's fame and striding off proud.
       -> ODYSSEUS centre-foreground right, turned in to the pit, first praising
          Achilles, then recounting Neoptolemus's courage at Troy.
   The praise, the rejection of death's glory, the question after son and father,
   the proud memory of Neoptolemus, Achilles's rejoicing stride and Ajax's
   silent refusal — all held on one clock in a single still.
