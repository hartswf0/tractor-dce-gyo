/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B13-S05 — Athena Makes the Beggar
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Athena touches Odysseus with her wand and shrivels his skin, hair, limbs.
     2. She clouds his eyes, dresses him in filthy rags, and gives him a staff
        and a patched bag.
     3. The transformed king is instructed to test the servants unrecognized.
     4. Athena departs for Sparta and Odysseus walks toward Eumaeus's farm.

   Stage layout (back -> front, read left -> right as the causal sweep):
     BEHIND — the DISGUISE TRANSFORMATION field spread across the whole stage:
              the strong original form on the left, the withered beggar on the
              right, the reversible corridor + the spark of Athena's wand at the
              crown. The divine morph that the whole scene turns on.
     LEFT   — ATHENA, wand out and commanding, touching the king and then, at the
              exit, striding away toward Sparta.
     RIGHT  — ODYSSEUS AS OLD BEGGAR, the finished disguise: stooped onto his
              staff, rheumy eyes climbing watchfully out of the bowed head,
              turning at the exit to shuffle off toward Eumaeus's farm.
     FRONT  — the given equipment laid at the edges: the filthy BEGGAR RAGS and
              the BEGGAR STAFF AND BAG she hands the transformed king.
