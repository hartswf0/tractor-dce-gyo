/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B09-S04 — Goat Island and the Cyclops Coast
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. The fleet reaches a fertile, unworked island opposite the Cyclopes' land.
     2. In darkness the ships enter a sheltered harbor and rest.
     3. At dawn the crews hunt wild goats and feast, watching smoke across the
        channel.
     4. Odysseus takes one ship and selects twelve men to investigate.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     the GOAT ISLAND HARBOR as the empty navigable set, full bleed: the sheltered
     cove water, the wooded hunting slopes, the beach camp on the strand, the
     channel lookout, and the far mainland across the channel mouth.
       -> the CYCLOPS COAST placed small and distant across the channel — the
          neighboring people's land, its cook-smoke rising (the smoke the crews
          watch while they feast).
       -> the WILD GOATS grazing on the hunting slopes / strand — the dawn quarry
          the crews take and feast on.
       -> the SELECTED TWELVE SAILORS in the right foreground with the one leading
          ship at the water's edge — the crew Odysseus picks to go and look.
       -> ODYSSEUS in the near foreground, ahead of the band, hailing the smoking
          coast and then striding out to embark with the chosen twelve.
   The landfall, the sheltered rest, the goat-hunt feast, and the picked ship —
   all held on one clock in a single still.
