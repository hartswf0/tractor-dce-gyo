   SCENE  OD-B13-S03 — The Cretan Lie Meets Its Match
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. The shepherd tells Odysseus he is in Ithaca; the hero suppresses his joy.
     2. He invents a Cretan identity and a story of killing a king's son and
        fleeing by Phoenician ship.
     3. Athena laughs, changes to her divine form, and praises his incurable cunning.
     4. Odysseus tests her loyalty and complains she abandoned him after Troy.
     5. She explains that Poseidon's anger required concealment, not open rescue.

   Stage layout (back -> front, read left -> right as the causal sweep on one clock):
     BACK   — ITHACA REVEALED: the disguising mist withdrawing from the familiar
              terrain the hero failed to know — the sheltered harbour of Phorcys,
              the wooded slope of Neriton with its still-veiled summit, the cave of
              the nymphs and the long-leaved olive. The land the shepherd names.
     CENTRE — SHEPHERD-TO-GODDESS TRANSFORMATION: the small floppy-capped shepherd
              on the left morphing into the tall radiant armored goddess on the
              right, a growth arrow spanning the change and an identity link proving
              one being through the disguise. The moment the lie meets its match.
     FRONT-L— ODYSSEUS: the crafty king, joy swallowed, spinning the Cretan lie with
              an open persuasive palm — then turning to test her and complain.
     FRONT-R— ATHENA: the bright-eyed goddess revealed, laughing at his cunning and
              then explaining, hand open, why Poseidon's anger demanded concealment.
   The named land, the transformation, the liar and the goddess who out-knows him —
   all held on one clock in a single still.
