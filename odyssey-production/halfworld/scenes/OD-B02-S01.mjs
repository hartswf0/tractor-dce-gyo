   SCENE  OD-B02-S01 — Telemachus Calls the Assembly
   Book 1 (Book 2 of the poem). A THIN Halfworld composition module: it places
   existing asset instances on one clock. It does NOT redraw any asset.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. At dawn Telemachus dresses, arms himself, and orders heralds to summon Ithaca.
     2. He enters the meeting ground with two hounds and takes Odysseus's old seat.
     3. Aegyptius asks who has called the first assembly since the fleet sailed for Troy.
     4. Telemachus rises with the speaker's staff and names the double ruin of his
        father and his house.

   Composition (back -> front):
     location.ithacan-assembly-ground   (full-bleed civic bowl: tiers, elders, bema)
     ensemble.people-of-ithaca          (the summoned citizens filling the ranks)
     creature.two-hounds                (the prince's pair, at his side)
     character.aegyptius                (the stooped elder, risen first at the front arc)
     character.telemachus               (the prince, rising on the speaker's stone)

   The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card over the whole stage, so every
   instance shares a single halftone. Deterministic (no Date/random).
