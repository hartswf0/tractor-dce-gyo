/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B11-S05 — The Heroines of the Past
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus lets a succession of famous women drink and identify their lineages.
     2. Tyro tells of Poseidon and her river-born sons.
     3. Many heroines appear in turn.
     4. The sequence becomes a living genealogy of desire, birth, crime, and death.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     UNDERWORLD CHORUS fills the whole murk as the ambient field — the hushed
     female voices of Erebus, receding to focus on whichever shade names herself.
       -> the GENEALOGY FIELD surfaces across the centre: the faint kinship-line
          network of the recited bloodlines, generation by generation, one line
          traced up to a god as each heroine speaks her descent.
       -> the HEROINES' SHADES, the waiting chorus of famous women, one shade
          stepped FORWARD to the blood-trench to testify while the rest listen.
       -> ODYSSEUS at the foreground left, presiding at the trench: letting the
          women drink one at a time and drawing out each lineage.
   The drinking, Tyro's telling, the turning succession and the whole surfacing
   into a living genealogy of desire, birth, crime and death — one clock, one still.
