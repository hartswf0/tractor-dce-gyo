/* OD-B02-S02 — The Secret of Penelope's Loom
   A thin Halfworld COMPOSITION module. It places existing assets on one master
   clock; it does not redraw any of them. The engine runs a single dotify + card
   pass over the whole stage, so every instance shares one halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Antinous rejects Telemachus's charge and blames Penelope for prolonging
        the courtship.
     2. He recounts how she wove Laertes's shroud by day and secretly unravelled
        it by night.
     3. A maid exposed the deception and the suitors forced her to finish the web.
     4. Antinous demands that Telemachus send his mother back to Icarius to choose
        a husband.

   Staging: the present-time assembly ground frames the whole space. Upper-center,
   as a recalled TORCHLIT NIGHT MEMORY, hangs the temporal-split loom overlay — the
   web woven by day, unpicked by night. Within that memory the queen PENELOPE works
   her LOOM (the shroud object). In the foreground the two present-time speakers:
   ANTINOUS jabs his accusation from the left, TELEMACHUS receives the charge on the
   right. On the master clock the memory runs its telling — day-weave (beat 2) into
   night-unravel, then the shroud forced to completion (beat 3) — while Antinous
   turns from the accusing jab (beats 1-2) to the flat command (beat 4). */
