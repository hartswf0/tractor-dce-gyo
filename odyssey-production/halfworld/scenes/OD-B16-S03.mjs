/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B16-S03 — The Father Reveals Himself
   REFERENCE SCENE for Book XVI+. Additive: adds nothing to Books I–XV and
   modifies no existing module.

   Three things are demonstrated here, and every later Book XVI+ scene should
   copy this shape:

   1. NO HAND-PLACED ANCHORS. Every position comes from scenes/_plans/
      eumaeus-hut.mjs via blockingAt(). The room is authored once; this scene
      only says who is at which station and when they move. S01 and S06 play
      in the same room and will agree with it automatically.

   2. ONE BODY. Odysseus is character.odysseus-b16 with a guise ramp, not a
      cut from .odysseus-as-beggar to .odysseus-restored. Skin, hair and height
      interpolate; the garment snaps at u=0.5, and the restoration flare is put
      on that exact frame to cover the only discontinuity. The audience must
      read one man changing, which is the entire content of the scene.

   3. STRUCTURED HANDOFF. exitOccupancy is computed from the plan, not written
      as prose, so OD-B16-S04 opens with both men exactly where this left them.

   Beats (Od. 16.166–219):
     1. Athena signals from the door; Odysseus steps out and is restored.
     2. He re-enters transformed; Telemachus takes him for a god and shrinks back.
     3. "I am no god. I am your father."
     4. Telemachus refuses it — no mortal could do this.
     5. It is Athena's work. They embrace and weep, longer than birds crying.

   ROOM NOTE. The atlas casts no location for this scene (5 of 6 Book XVI
   scenes have none), so restage had nothing to paint the field with. The
   field is now location.eumaeus-hut-interior, which builds its architecture
   by projecting scenes/_plans/eumaeus-hut.mjs through the same project()
   used here — so the door, hearth, benches and stool this scene names are
   the door, hearth, benches and stool that get drawn.

   Verify:  node harness/render-scene.mjs scenes/OD-B16-S03.mjs --t 14
