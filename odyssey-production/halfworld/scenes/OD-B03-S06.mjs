/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B03-S06 — The Chariot Road to Sparta
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Nestor orders the horses harnessed and provisions loaded for Telemachus.
     2. Pisistratus takes the reins beside him and drives out of Pylos.
     3. They spend the night at Phera under Diocles's hospitality.
     4. At dawn they continue through the wheatlands toward Lacedaemon.

   Stage layout (back -> front):
     the Pylos-to-Sparta road (Pylos gate · Phera lodging · wheatlands · the
     mountain pass toward Sparta, full frame)
       -> the matched harness team, yoked and pulling forward (mid-ground)
       -> Nestor's Pylian chariot rolling behind the team
       -> Telemachus riding as passenger on the open car
       -> Pisistratus at the front rail with the reins in both fists (foreground).
   The road supplies the whole overland journey in one navigable set; the team
   pulls the chariot along it; the two young princes ride it out toward Sparta.
