   SCENE  OD-B15-S03 — Theoclymenus Joins the Voyage
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. At the Pylian harbor Telemachus orders the crew to ready the ship.
     2. The fugitive seer Theoclymenus approaches and asks for passage after
        killing a kinsman.
     3. Telemachus accepts him and places him aboard.
     4. The ship leaves under Athena's wind and sails through the night toward
        Ithaca.

   Stage layout (back -> front, read LEFT -> RIGHT as the causal sweep):
     BACKDROP — PYLOS HARBOR spread across the whole stage: night-lit sky, the
                open sea, the tapering open-sea ROUTE OUT, the sandy beach, the
                farewell waterline, the chariot road and the crew staging ring.
                Drawn WITHOUT its own berthed ship — the crew ensemble supplies
                the working vessel, so the two don't fight.
     MID      — TELEMACHUS'S CREW at the moored ship: the practised homeward
                company loading guest-gifts up the gangplank, boarding over the
                gunwale and shipping their looms — the readied vessel of beats
                1 & 3, brisk to the prince's order.
     RIGHT    — ATHENA'S HOMEWARD WIND as the terminus panel: the ship under a
                taut square sail, the goddess's star-emblem breathing the gusts,
                the bold safe-path arrow lifting over the suitors' ambush X to
                the home landfall — beat 4, the overnight run to Ithaca.
     FRONT    — TELEMACHUS at the left, turned to the ship, ordering the crew
                then opening a hand to accept the suppliant; THEOCLYMENUS beside
                him, the fugitive seer bowed and both hands offered, begging
                passage, then boarded.
