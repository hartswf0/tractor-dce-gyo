   SCENE  OD-B14-S01 — The Dogs at Eumaeus's Yard
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus approaches Eumaeus's remote pig farm in disguise.
     2. Four savage dogs rush him; he drops his staff and sits to avoid attack.
     3. Eumaeus runs out, scatters the dogs with stones, and brings him inside.
     4. He offers his own seat and prepares two young pigs for a meal.

   Stage layout (back -> front, read as the causal sweep):
     SET    — EUMAEUS'S PIG FARM behind everything: hilltop stockade yard, stone
              hut back-right, pig pens mid-left, the yard fire and visitor's seat.
     MID    — the PIG HERD milling in its pens, upper-left.
     FRONT  — the GUARD DOGS charging in from yard-centre (facing right toward the
              intruder), ODYSSEUS AS BEGGAR dropped onto his haunches right of them
              (staff released, palms spread, watching the pack), and EUMAEUS bursting
              from the hut on the right, stone cocked, warding the dogs off — then,
              at the exit, turning his kind open-handed welcome on the stranger.
