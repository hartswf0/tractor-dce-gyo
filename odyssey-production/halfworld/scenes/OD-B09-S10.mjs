/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B09-S10 — Escape beneath the Rams
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. At dawn Polyphemus opens the cave and feels every animal's back as it passes.
     2. Odysseus binds three rams abreast for each man, suspending a sailor
        beneath the middle animal.
     3. He clings beneath the great lead ram while Polyphemus speaks tenderly to it.
     4. Outside, the men release themselves, drive the flock to the ship, and row away.
     5. They divide the animals and sacrifice the great ram to Zeus.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock). Read LEFT -> RIGHT as time:
     the CYCLOPS BEACH AND WAITING SHIP as the empty navigable set, full bleed:
     the dark cave-mouth + switchback path on the left headland, the flat sand
     and launch water, the moored ship prow-to-sea on the right.
       -> POLYPHEMUS at the cave mouth (left), blind, groping — the gatekeeper
          feeling every back as the flock files out at dawn.
       -> the LEAD RAM passing right beneath him, Odysseus cinched flat under its
          belly, held in the extended pause under the searching giant hand.
       -> the ESCAPE RAM TEAMS mid-frame: three rams lashed abreast, a sailor
          slung beneath the middle beast, edging carefully clear of the cave.
       -> ODYSSEUS on the sand near the berth (right), released and upright now,
          driving the freed flock down to the waiting ship.
       -> the freed FLOCK grazing at the berth (a second ram-team, unbound) —
          the animals gathered to be divided, the great ram set apart for Zeus.
   Dawn's blind groping, the three-abreast rig, the lead-ram anchor, the drive to
   the ship and the divided flock — all held on one clock in a single still.
