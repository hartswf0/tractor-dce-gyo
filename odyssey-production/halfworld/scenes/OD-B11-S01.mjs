/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B11-S01 — The Blood Pit Opens
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. The ship reaches the misty land of the Cimmerians at Ocean's edge.
     2. Odysseus digs a trench, pours libations, sacrifices sheep, and holds
        the spirits back with his sword.
     3. The dead gather in multitudes, crying around the blood.
     4. Odysseus waits for Tiresias before allowing any other shade to drink.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     THE CIMMERIAN SHORE AND UNDERWORLD PIT fills the whole field — the
     sunless fog-sky, the black ocean-stream, Persephone's dark grove, the
     beached ship, the river-meeting and, in the foreground, the dug blood-
     trench with its sacrifice zone and the scored ghost-perimeter ring.
       -> the GATHERING SHADES throng the scored ring around the pit, drawn
          in by the blood, crying and straining at the boundary but held out.
       -> the CREW RITUAL ASSISTANTS work the rite at the left of the pit —
          the diggers and pourers who raised the trench and the libations.
       -> the BLACK EWE AND RAM at the pit's edge, throats bared, their dark
          blood running down into the trench: the offering that calls the dead.
       -> ODYSSEUS in the near foreground, sword drawn and raised across the
          pit, holding the multitude of shades back until Tiresias comes.
   Landfall, the dug pit and poured blood, the crying crowd of the dead, and
   the drawn sword that waits for the prophet — all on one clock in one still.
