/* ============================================================
   SCENE  OD-B09-S08 — The Name Nobody and the Stake
   A thin Halfworld composition module. It COMPOSES existing atlas assets on
   one clock — it never redraws them. The engine runs ONE dotify + scene card
   over the whole stage, so every instance shares a single halftone.

   Beats (causal order):
     1. Odysseus considers killing the sleeping giant but realizes the sealing
        stone would trap the men in the cave forever.
     2. At dawn Polyphemus eats two more men and drives the flock out, sealing
        the cave behind him.
     3. Odysseus cuts and smooths an olive trunk into a stake and hardens its
        point in the fire.
     4. The men hide the stake and draw lots for the four who will help wield it.
     5. When the giant returns, Odysseus offers the potent wine and gives his
        name as Nobody.

   Stage layout (back -> front, one master clock):
     POLYPHEMUS'S CAVE as the empty navigable set, full bleed — vault, sealed
     entrance, hearth-fire, cheese racks and pens — the trap Odysseus reads.
       -> the FOUR CHOSEN HELPERS in the cave's left depth: the lot-picked crew
          rehearsing the coordinated heave on the great beam (their own drawn
          lots on the floor before them).
       -> POLYPHEMUS, colossal at the right, returned with the flock and settling
          by the fire — the giant Odysseus first thought to kill, now the guest
          to be plied.
       -> the OLIVEWOOD STAKE, fire-hardened and set upright against the wall at
          the left, its charred point ready and hidden from the giant's eye.
       -> ODYSSEUS, foreground centre, turning from the trap to the offering —
          the crafty half-smile, the persuasive open hand — lifting the wine.
       -> the WINE CUP, the great crude ivy-wood bowl of Maron's dark wine,
          tipped toward the giant in Odysseus's grip: the offer, and the name.
   The abandoned killing, the sealed dawn, the worked and hidden stake, the
   drawn lots and the offered wine with the false name — all one clock, one still.
