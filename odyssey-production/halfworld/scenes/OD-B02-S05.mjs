/* ============================================================
   SCENE OD-B02-S05 — Athena Answers on the Shore
   Book 2 (staged in the atlas's Book-1 clock family). A thin Halfworld
   COMPOSITION module: it places existing assets on ONE master clock and
   lets the engine run a single dotify + card pass over the whole stage.
   No asset is redrawn here.

   Staged beat (View-1): Telemachus walks alone down to the Ithacan
   waterline, washes his hands in the grey surf, and prays to Athena at the
   marked prayer stone. The goddess answers — she stands beside him wearing
   the familiar elder MENTOR, tall and certain, the divine tell leaking
   through the old man's bright eyes, and promises he will not lack courage.
   Her counsel hardens into logistical COMMAND: gather provisions while she
   recruits a crew and finds a ship. Over the sea the following-wind
   POTENTIAL gathers — latent gust arrows lengthening toward the voyage —
   as the whole enterprise becomes a hidden operation under the suitors' gaze.

   Cast (back -> front):
     shore     location.ithacan-shore                              (the set)
     wind      environment.sea-foam-and-following-wind-potential   (gust overlay)
     telemachus character.telemachus                               (prays -> resolves)
     mentor    character.athena-as-mentor                          (answers -> commands)
