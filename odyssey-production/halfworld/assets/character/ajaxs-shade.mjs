/* character.ajaxs-shade — the pale ghost of Great Ajax, the silent warrior.
   CHARACTER asset. In the House of the Dead (OD-B11-S07) Odysseus tries to
   make peace with the shade of Ajax — who killed himself after the arms of
   the dead Achilles were awarded to Odysseus, not to him. But Ajax will not
   answer. He turns his massive back and stalks off into the dark without a
   word: the most eloquent silence in the poem — a huge hulking armored figure
   refusing eye contact or speech over the armor judgment.

   Built on the HALFTRACK hero rig. Distinct silhouette: a big, broad, BEARDED
   warrior in heavy battle ARMOR under a war-cloak, faded near-white hair and
   beard, bare-shinned in sandals, scaled up so he looms. He is a shade, so
   the whole figure is drawn TRANSLUCENT (paper bleeds through the dot pass).

   EXPRESSIVENESS — the opposite of every other card: the emotion here is a
   REFUSAL. The rig reads face channels from the composed POSE, so Ajax ships
   bespoke poses into the shared registry that TURN HIM AWAY — body yawed off
   the viewer, head turned further aside, gaze locked away (never eye contact),
   heavy arms FOLDED shut or hanging in fists, jaw clamped SHUT (he never
   speaks), and a stony resentful brow (knit hard) wherever a sliver of face
   shows. That closed, turned-away body IS the performance. */
import { makeFigure, HERO_POSES } from "../../engine/halfworld-engine.mjs";

/* ---- bespoke Ajax poses (additive; shared table) ----
   Conventions: he never gestures OUT — the arms fold in (crossed) or hang in
   heavy fists. Every beat yaws the body AWAY, casts the gaze off the viewer,
   and clamps jaw=0 (silence). A broad, forward carriage (chestOpen + a high
   rootScale bulk) is baked into every beat. */

// THE CARD — COLD SHOULDER: the body wheeled to a full PROFILE and the head
// turned further off along it, so he presents his side and stares ahead into
// the dark — never at us. Head bowed, shoulders hunched, huge arms hanging in
// heavy fists. Brows knit hard over a narrowed eye and a mouth clamped in a
// stony, bitter silence. The whole refusal carried in the turned-away body.
