/* character.athena-as-shepherd — Athena's Book 13 disguise on the Ithacan shore.
   A DISGUISE variant of character.athena: the goddess folds herself into the
   body of a DELICATE YOUNG HERDSMAN — a slight, youthful, clean-shaven local
   in a short tunic with a cloak thrown back, a SHEPHERD'S CROOK in the near
   hand, standing easy on the beach where the sleeping Odysseus has just been
   set down. She meets his instant reflexive lie — the stranger inventing a
   Cretan past on the spot — not with anger but with delight: she is AMUSED by
   the reflex, leaning on the crook with a knowing sidelong half-smile before
   she drops the disguise and laughs. The mortal shell is a herd-boy, but the
   same tell that leaks through every Athena disguise leaks through here: the
   eyes stay unnaturally BRIGHT, a divine glint too knowing for a shepherd.
   That bright-eye cue is the continuity thread back to character.athena.

   Scene function:
     OD-B13-S02 — young local figure amused by the hero's reflexive deception

   Built on the engine hero rig: a slight youthful scale, a short tunic + cloak
   over bare legs, and a shepherd's crook carried in the NEAR (viewer-left) hand
   across every beat while the FAR (right) arm does the acting — an amused
   palm-up shrug, a quiet laugh, a light word, a relaxed lean. The crook is
   drawn around the figure so it reads crisp, and the divine bright-eye
   catchlight is painted last. All solid grays + hard contour — the engine's
   dotify POST pass supplies the halftone, so nothing is pre-dithered. */
