/* character.patroclus-and-antilochus — two quiet companion shades who frame
   Achilles in the House of Hades. A two-figure CHARACTER: draws BOTH of the
   great warrior's dead companions — Patroclus, his heart's brother, and
   Antilochus, the swift young son of Nestor — standing in silent attendance
   on either side of the empty center where Achilles's shade arrives.

   They are pale translucent young soldiers, NOT the drama of the scene: their
   whole performance is stillness. Calm attending poses, hands folded or a
   quiet hand laid to the chest, heads bowed a little, solemn faces (brows
   lifted AND knit in a settled grief, gaze soft, turned inward toward the
   space Achilles fills). Rendered as SHADES like Achilles: pale skin, faint
   light ink (drawn low-alpha so the dotify pass thins the contour and the
   paper bleeds through), lower bodies washing out into the field of asphodel.

   Distinct silhouettes so the two never read as one doubled figure:
     · Patroclus (LEFT)  — the elder companion: curly hair, a short beard,
       light armor, a heavier steadier build, a hand laid over his heart.
     · Antilochus (RIGHT) — the youngest: beardless, short hair, a plain
       soldier's tunic, a slighter frame, hands clasped low, head bowed.
   Both turn INWARD to frame the center — left faces right, right faces left.

   Composes the HALFTRACK hero rig TWICE, one attendant per side. Ships bespoke
   calm-attendance poses into the shared registry (each fusing a solemn
   brow/gaze with a quiet arm gesture — the expressiveness lives in the hush).
   States: attending / vigil / greeting.
