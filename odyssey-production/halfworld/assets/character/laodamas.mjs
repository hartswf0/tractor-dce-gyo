/* character.laodamas — the courteous young Phaeacian prince, Alcinous's son.
   CHARACTER asset on the HALFTRACK hero rig. Where Euryalus is the sharp, well-
   built athlete who taunts the stranger, Laodamas is the gracious one: the son
   who INVITES the guest into the games and, when the taunt sours the hall, helps
   set it right. He reads as a young prince by FINER DRESS (a rich robe + a
   fastened cloak, shod not bare-legged, a slim brow-fillet of a prince) and by an
   OPEN, inviting bearing — beardless, bright-faced, chest turned out, a hand
   perpetually offered forward.

   Scene function:
     OD-B08-S03  the courteous prince inviting the stranger to take part in the
                 games, and later supporting the reconciliation after Euryalus's
                 taunt.

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (smile, browUp, browKnit,
   eyeWide, eyeNarrow, jaw, mouthAsym, gaze) off the composed POSE. Laodamas's
   register — warm invitation, a hosting sweep, an earnest conciliatory reach —
   needs brow + gaze + arm authored TOGETHER, so (like alcinous/pisistratus) he
   ships bespoke poses into the shared POSE registry the hero figure reads. A slim
   princely fillet is drawn on top afterward in solid grays + hard contour so the
   engine POST pass halftones it with the rest of the figure. */
