/* character.achilless-shade — the pale ghost of the greatest of the Achaeans.
   CHARACTER asset. In the House of Hades (OD-B11-S07) Odysseus finds the
   shade of Achilles — a powerful young armored hero — and praises his glory
   among the dead. Achilles answers with STRIPPED-DOWN REGRET (he would
   rather be a hired hand among the living than king of all the perished
   dead), then is REVIVED to pride by news that his son Neoptolemus fights
   like a hero, and strides off across the field of asphodel, head high.

   Built on the HALFTRACK hero rig. Distinct silhouette: a tall, strong,
   BEARDLESS young warrior in ARMOR with bare warrior's legs — but rendered
   as a SHADE: pale skin, ghostly LIGHT ink (the figure drawn faint so the
   dotify pass thins the ink and lets the paper bleed through), lower body
   washing out into the asphodel. Strong build carried by an up-scaled rig.

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the rig reads face channels from the composed POSE + a
   thin scene overlay, so Achilles ships bespoke poses into the shared
   registry — each fusing a specific brow/jaw/gaze with an ARM gesture. That
   is the whole emotional arc: bowed regret (head down, palm turned up in
   weary "what use was glory") -> revived pride (chest flung open, chin
   lifted, arm raised) -> a proud martial stride. */

// THE CARD — stripped-down regret, speaking. Head bowed heavy, gaze cast down

// confession, the right hand turned palm-up in a weary "what was any of it
