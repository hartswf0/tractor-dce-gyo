/* character.menelaus — the wealthy, war-returned king of Sparta, whose hall
   glitters with Trojan spoils and whose every act of hospitality keeps opening
   a door onto grief. CHARACTER asset on the HALFTRACK hero rig: a mature, fair-
   haired (xanthos) Atreid — full beard, a rich robe and cloak, a golden circlet
   across his brow. The lavish host who cannot pour wine without weeping for the
   dead he left at Troy, and the man who once wrestled the shape-shifting Old Man
   of the Sea to wring the truth from him.

   Scene function:
     OD-B04-S01  wealthy war-returned king whose HOSPITALITY opens into GRIEF
     OD-B04-S02  host moving from MEMORY to RECOGNITION and shared grief
     OD-B04-S05  narrator enduring a prolonged SUPERNATURAL GRAPPLE (Proteus)
     OD-B04-S06  lavish HOST adapting his generosity to his guests

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (browUp, browKnit, frown,
   eyeWide, eyeNarrow, jaw, mouthAsym) off the composed POSE. Menelaus's whole
   register — a welcoming gesture that shades mid-motion into sorrow, the buckle
   from memory into recognition, the clenched strain of the wrestling match — needs
   brow + gaze + arm authored TOGETHER. So (like nestor/halitherses) he ships
   bespoke poses into the shared POSE registry the hero figure reads, so the card
   and every state genuinely EMOTE. A golden circlet is drawn on top afterward. */
