/* character.proteus — the Old Man of the Sea. CHARACTER asset on the HALFTRACK
   hero rig: the ancient shape-shifting sea-prophet — a very old man, white mane
   and streaming patriarch's beard, draped in seaweed, weathered by salt. His
   STABLE base form is this seaweed-hung elder; his gift is metamorphosis, so his
   states hint the beast / water / tree variants of the transformation chain
   (see divine_fx/... transformation FX): lion, serpent, leopard, boar, running
   water, a tall tree — each held in the body of the same old man before he slips
   into it.

   Scene function:
     OD-B04-S05  ancient sea prophet cycling rapid lion, serpent, leopard, boar,
                 water, tree variants while gripped — Menelaus must hold him fast.

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (browUp, browKnit, eyeWide,
   eyeNarrow, frown, jaw, mouthAsym) from the composed POSE. The states Proteus
   must hit — the wary prophet grasping at water, the lion's roar, the serpent's
   sideways weave, the coiled leopard, the lowered boar, the dissolving flow of
   water, the raised stillness of a tree — need brow + gaze + arm authored
   TOGETHER, so Proteus ships bespoke poses into the shared POSE registry (the
   same instance the hero figure reads) so the card and every state EMOTE. */
