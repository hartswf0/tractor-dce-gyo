/* character.leocritus — a brash young suitor who dismisses civic authority
   and boasts of the suitors' numbers.
   CHARACTER asset built on the engine hero rig. Silhouette: young, cocky,
   athletic, clean-shaven with short tousled hair, a plain belted TUNIC over
   bare sandalled legs — deliberately NOT the fine noble robe+cloak of
   Eurymachus nor the bearded curls of Odysseus. He reads YOUNG and loud: a
   swaggering arms-open stance and a wide boastful grin. Expression is the
   point — the open contemptuous shrug/wave and the numbers-are-on-our-side
   grin.
