/* character.eurymachus — the smooth, handsome ringleader of the suitors.
   CHARACTER asset. A young noble who ridicules the eagle-omen and redirects
   the hall's fear into a threat of social punishment. Built on the engine
   hero rig. Silhouette: taller athletic build, clean-shaven, sleek dark
   styled hair, a fine noble ROBE with a mantled cloak (well-dressed, moneyed)
   — deliberately distinct from Odysseus (bearded, curls, tunic) and the
   slighter beardless Telemachus. Expression is the point: a scornful smirk
   (skewed mouth, one lifted brow, narrowed eyes) over a dismissive gesture.
