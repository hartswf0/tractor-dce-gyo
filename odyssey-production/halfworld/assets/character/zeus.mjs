/* character.zeus — the cloud-gatherer, father of gods and men.
   CHARACTER asset. Scene function (OD-B01-S01): the troubled sovereign
   speaks from seated authority, then rises to defend the gods' treatment
   of Odysseus. Built on the HALFTRACK hero rig — a mature, bearded king in
   a heavy robe, broad-shouldered, grey of hair, bearing the weight of a
   crown he never takes off. Stable identity across front/three-quarter/
   profile/back; face, gaze, mouth, hands, and every joint stay exposed to
   the rig so scenes can drive him.

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (browKnit, browUp,
   eyeNarrow, frown, jaw, mouthAsym) ONLY from the composed POSE, and the
   scene-state mouth overlay can only make a smile or a frown-line — never a
   grave OPEN mouth. So Zeus ships his own bespoke poses in the shared POSE
   registry, each one fusing a knit/heavy brow + an open decreeing jaw + a
   gesturing arm. That is what lets the card actually EMOTE. */
