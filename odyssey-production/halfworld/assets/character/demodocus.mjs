/* character.demodocus — the blind inspired bard of the Phaeacians.
   CHARACTER asset on the HALFTRACK hero rig: an older man whose sight is
   gone (closed, blank eyes) but whose song is god-given. Robed, seated-bard
   bearing, a phorminx (lyre) cradled to the chest and raised as he projects.
   His whole identity is the INSPIRED BLIND FACE: sightless eyes, chin lifted,
   brows raised, mouth open in song — the Muse pouring through a man who
   cannot see his own audience.

   Scene function:
     OD-B08-S02  blind bard locating the lyre and PROJECTING SONG, unaware
                 the stranger (Odysseus) has collapsed weeping nearby
     OD-B08-S05  bard performing an EXACT story — proof of divine inspiration

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (blink, browUp, browKnit,
   jaw, smile, gaze) from the composed pose + state. Blindness is authored with
   blink≈1 (eyes held closed — no pupils) in EVERY state, so he never "looks"
   at anything; the rapture is carried by lifted brows + a raised chin + an open
   jaw. Like Nestor/Phemius he ships bespoke poses into the shared POSE registry
   so brow + head-lift + arms-on-the-lyre are authored together and every state
   actually emotes. The lyre is a capability layer, cradled upright against the
   chest (the flat rig splays any "reach" sideways, so it anchors to the torso,
   not the hands) and RAISED in the song states. Stowed on the back turn. */
