/* character.echeneus — the eldest of the Phaeacian counselors. CHARACTER asset
   on the HALFTRACK hero rig. In the hall of Alcinous, Odysseus the suppliant
   has clasped the queen's knees at the hearth and a stunned silence has fallen
   over the whole company. It is Echeneus — the oldest man there, "an elder of
   the Phaeacians, versed beyond all in speech and old in lore" — who breaks it,
   rising to chide the king: a guest must not be left sitting in the ashes; lift
   him up, seat him, pour the wine. A hospitality correction from the eldest.

   Scene function:
     OD-B07-S03  old counselor breaking collective silence with a hospitality
                 correction — rising to advise/admonish the king.

   DISTINCT DRESS (the prompt asks for an elder LIKE Nestor/Aegyptius but set
   apart): where the war-generation Achaean elders wear mid-grey robes under a
   cloak, Echeneus is a PHAEACIAN — wrapped to the ankle in a heavy dark
   ceremonial MANTLE (garment:"cloak"), and he is the WHITEST-haired of them all
   (he is the eldest man in any hall he enters). The dark swathed mass + white
   mane/beard give him his own strong-contrast silhouette. He rises tall and
   grave rather than stooping like Aegyptius, and leans on a tall counselor's
   staff at his left side.

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads POSTURE + ARM channels (spineLean,
   headPitch, armR*, shoulderLift) ONLY from the composed POSE; the scene overlay
   drives the FACE (brows, eyes, jaw, mouth). The rising-and-admonishing raised
   hand, the grave lifted chin, the lowered weighing hand — each needs spine +
   head + arm authored TOGETHER. So Echeneus ships bespoke poses into the shared
   POSE registry (the same module instance the hero figure reads) so the card and
   every state actually EMOTE. */
