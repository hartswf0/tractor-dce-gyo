/* character.aeolus — the genial wind-keeper king of the floating isle of Aeolia,
   who binds the storm-winds in an ox-hide bag and gives them to a guest, then, when
   that guest is blown back to his door a second time, recoils in horror and turns
   him away as a man the gods must hate. CHARACTER asset on the HALFTRACK hero rig:
   a mature, full-bearded king in a rich robe + cloak, set apart from the other
   host-kings (Alcinous/Menelaus/Nestor) not by a crown but by a low WIND-AND-CLOUD
   CIRCLET — a band ringed with curling gust-spirals and a little cloud puff.

   Scene function:
     OD-B10-S01  the generous wind-keeper — open-handed, handing over the bag of
                 winds — becoming HORRIFIED and ABSOLUTE when the failed guests
                 return: recoil, a warding hand, a final refusal.

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (browUp, browKnit, frown,
   eyeWide, eyeNarrow, jaw, mouthAsym) off the composed POSE. Aeolus's arc — the
   warm two-handed GIVING of the bag, then the flinch back with one hand flung up
   to WARD the returning stranger off, then the hard flat FINALITY of his refusal —
   needs brow + gaze + arm authored TOGETHER. So (like alcinous/nestor) he ships
   bespoke poses into the shared POSE registry the hero figure reads, so the card
   and every state genuinely EMOTE. The circlet is drawn on top in solid grays +
   hard contour so the engine POST pass halftones it with the rest of the figure. */
