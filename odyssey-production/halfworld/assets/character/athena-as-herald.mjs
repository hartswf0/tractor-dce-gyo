/* character.athena-as-herald — Athena's Book 8 disguise in the streets of Scheria.
   A DISGUISE variant of character.athena: the goddess takes the body of a
   PHAEACIAN TOWN HERALD — a brisk, clean-shaven civic crier in a short tunic
   and a herald's cloak, a knobbed herald's staff in the near hand, an olive
   crier's wreath on the brow. She moves through the town raising a proclaiming
   voice, calling the Phaeacians to assembly to look on the stranger — a mobile
   civic voice recruiting curiosity while never naming who really sends the call.
   The mortal shell is complete, but the same tell that leaks through every
   Athena disguise leaks through here: the eyes stay unnaturally BRIGHT, a divine
   glint too knowing for a town crier. That bright-eye cue is the continuity
   thread back to character.athena (the flashing-eyed goddess).

   Scene function:
     OD-B08-S01 — mobile civic voice recruiting curiosity while concealing
                  divine authorship

   Built on the engine hero rig: the near (viewer-left) arm holds the staff
   down at the side across every beat, while the FAR (right) arm does the acting
   — flung up in proclamation, thrust out to summon, swinging in a stride, or
   dropped low and confiding. Staff + wreath are drawn around the figure so they
   read crisp. All solid grays + hard contour — the engine's dotify POST pass
   supplies the halftone, so nothing is pre-dithered. */
