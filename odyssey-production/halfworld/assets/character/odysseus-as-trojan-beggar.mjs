/* character.odysseus-as-trojan-beggar — the disguise.
   Odysseus stripped of his king's tunic: same skin, same curly hair and
   beard (grizzled and filthy now), but scarred, in torn rags, folded down
   into a furtive stoop. The body reads as a beaten mendicant; the FACE does
   not — the eyes stay disciplined, narrow, sharply awake, sliding sideways
   from under a bowed brow. The whole point of the asset is that contrast:
   a wreck of a posture CONTAINING watchful observation and coiled force.
   Atlas performance: OD-B04-S03. Shares Odysseus' identity params so the
   two modules render as the same man in two skins. */
