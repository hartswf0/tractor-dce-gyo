/* character.nestor — aged king of Pylos, gracious host, and the vast living
   archive of the Trojan war. CHARACTER asset on the HALFTRACK hero rig: a very
   old man — white beard and mane, long robe and cloak, a staff at his side,
   dignified and upright despite his years. His whole function is memory: he
   receives Telemachus as a host, then opens like a book and pours out the war.

   Scene function:
     OD-B03-S02  aged king shifting from HOST to LIVING ARCHIVE of the war
     OD-B03-S03  narrator MAPPING strategic choices — regret + exact route memory
     OD-B03-S04  mentor holding up remembered REVENGE as warning and model
     OD-B03-S05  awed host converting revelation into PRAYER

   EXPRESSIVENESS: the hero rig reads facial channels (browUp, browKnit,
   eyeWide, eyeNarrow, frown, jaw, mouthAsym) from the composed POSE, and the
   scene-state `mouth` overlay can only smile or draw a frown-line. The states
   Nestor must hit — the far-off reminiscing gaze of a storyteller, the regret
   of mapping a route only he remembers, the raised warning finger, the upward
   awe of prayer — need brow + gaze + arm authored TOGETHER. So Nestor ships
   bespoke poses into the shared POSE registry (the same module instance the
   hero figure reads) so the card and every state actually EMOTE. */
