# SCENE 7 – DOWNTOWN STREET SEQUENCE (Homer & Bart Parallel, Car + Skateboard)

## LDU Mathematics (Critical)

### **Horizontal Measurements**
```
20 LDU = 1 stud width (street lane unit)
40 LDU = 2x2 brick (building footprint or sidewalk)
80 LDU = 4 studs wide (traffic lane width)
160 LDU = 8 studs wide (road + sidewalk block)
320 LDU = 16 studs (camera pan arc radius)
```

### **Vertical Measurements**
```
8 LDU = 1 plate (curb height)
24 LDU = 1 brick (building step or traffic sign)
48 LDU = 2 bricks (streetlamp height)
80 LDU = minifig standing (street reference)
120 LDU = 5 bricks (storefront height)
240 LDU = 10 bricks (multi-story landmark)
```

### **Scene Volume**
```
Width:  320 LDU (X: -160 to +160) = 16 stud units
Depth:  400 LDU (Z: -200 to +200) = 20 stud units
Height: 240 LDU (Y: 0 to -240) = 10 brick units
Total:  16x20x10 brick volume (urban street + background buildings)
```

## Container First Philosophy – STREET AS THE MAIN CONTAINER

**Traditional:** Place vehicles, then arrange buildings/people
**Master Builder:** Lay **street** + curb grid first, layer buildings & action on top

### Why Container First?
- Street grid sets choreography pace
- Building placement controls background density (montage rhythm)
- Detailing curbs, signs before extras clarifies traffic and skate paths
- Street container holds sub-containers: vehicles, sidewalks, actors

---

## STREET LAYOUT – 4 Parallel Lanes & Key Landmarks

**Lane 1:** Homer’s brown sedan (right/center)
**Lane 2:** Bart’s skateboard path (zig-zagging)
**Lane 3:** Moe’s Tavern, crowd (Barney, Moe, Sideshow Bob, et al.)
**Lane 4:** Crowd/urban background: Lard Lad Donuts, bus stop

| Lane         | Path Content                          | Key Event                         |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Homer’s car  | Enters from nuclear plant            | Uranium rod thrown out window      |
| Bart’s board | Bursts from school, tricks/obstacles | One-hop on car, curb jump          |
| Moe’s crowd  | Waiting/gathered at sidewalks        | Character cameos, chaos           |
| Bus/Landmark | Stationary, receives uranium rod     | Rod bounces into Otto’s lap        |

---

### Traffic Control (Build Sequencing)
- Build street base (plate at Y=0) with 4 lanes
- Add curbs at 8 LDU (brick border)
- Place traffic signs, bus stop, storefronts as verticals (Y=24–120+)
- Insert building background as low-relief (building façades, LDU-accurate depth)
- Vehicles & minifigs placed after environment

---

## Character/Vehicle Trajectories

### **Homer’s Car (Brown)**
- Starts at X=-140, Y=0, Z=+190 (plant exit)
- PT43S: Crosses intersection X=-80
- PT45S: Throws uranium rod: Y=+60
- PT47S: Approaching home block: X=+20
- PT54S: Exit toward driveway (-verge)

**Special part:** Rod trajectory as trans-clear arc plate (demonstrate motion)

### **Bart’s Skateboard**
- Bursts X=+140, Z=+180, Y=8 (school front)
- Weaves traffic: Lane changes at each block (every 40 LDU)
- PT46S: Curbs/jumps: Z=+80 crossroads
- PT50S: Homer's car contact point (roof: Y=+48)
- PT54S: Approaches house (rolls off street segment)

**Critical:** Place jump plates/ramp bricks at each trick locus!

---

## Extras: Character Cameos (Sidewalks)
- Sideshow Bob: X=-60, Y=80, Z=+60, sword raised (layer 2)
- Moe: Door at X=0, Z=0 (Moe’s Tavern)
- Barney: Next to Moe at curb (Y=8, minifig on 1x2 plate)
- Apu, Helen Lovejoy, CBG, Wiggum: Each spaced 40 LDU apart on sidewalks

**Success:** Each extra *must* be in-frame for at least 0.5 seconds (timeline alignment to street grid)

---

## LDU Verification Checklist – Scene 7
- [ ] Street grid at Y=0, 4 lanes x 16 blocks
- [ ] All vertical signage/block features: Y=24/48/120 (brick heights)
- [ ] Each vehicle/character follows timed X/Z trajectory
- [ ] Uranium rod trajectory: arc, transparent piece
- [ ] Cameos spaced using sidewalk grid (no crowding)
- [ ] Camera pan matches LDU travel per frame

# SCENE 6 – SPRINGFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: LISA’S BAND ROOM

## LDU Mathematics (Critical)

### **Horizontal Measurements**
```
20 LDU = 1 stud width (desk/module space)
40 LDU = 2x2 brick (music stand spacing)
80 LDU = 4 studs (student seating row)
160 LDU = 8 studs (classroom width)
```

### **Vertical Measurements**
```
8 LDU = 1 plate (music stand height)
24 LDU = 1 brick (chair seat)

## Layer System – Music Room Container
- FLOOR (Y=0): Stage base, tan
- LOWER (Y=-24): Student chairs, instrument stands (20–40 LDU spacing)
- CONTROL (Y=-48): Teacher podium, Lisa’s solo, lead saxophone
- UPPER (Y=-72): Display banners, whiteboard, shelves
- CEILING (Y=-120): Room enclosure

---

## Build Steps
1. Build room container (walls, floor, ceiling)
2. Place whiteboard at North, banners at East/West (24 LDU up)
3. Student chairs: 20 LDU grid
4. Music stands: staggered front-to-back alternate rows
5. Tiled podium (Lisa soloist) at Y=-48, centered at X=0, Z=0
6. Minifigs: Lisa at front (sax), 3-4 students further back
7. Teacher minifig at podium, facing class

---

## LDU Verification Scene 6
- [ ] Every music stand 20 LDU apart
- [ ] Lisa solo raised 8 LDU above class
- [ ] Instrument minifigs not overlapping
- [ ] Teacher position: X=0, Z=-50

Height: 120 LDU (Y: 0 to -120) = 5 bricks
Total:  8x4x5 brick volume (CHECKOUT INTERIOR)
```
